          This will usually follow a visit and a meeting with the Headteacher
          and the child will be offered a trial day. It is important on this day
          they demonstrate that they can settle in and benefit from the
          environment that we offer. Depending on the age of the child, they may
          need to undertake some straightforward tests in Maths and English.
